# BiVeS Core module

![bives logo](https://sems.uni-rostock.de/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/logo-icon-16.png) BiVeS is a library based on the XyDiff algorithm. It is able to detect differences between two versions of a computational model and to communicate these changes.

The Algorithm implemented in BiVeS was published as
> Martin Scharm, Olaf Wolkenhauer, Dagmar Waltemath:
> [An algorithm to detect and communicate the differences in computational models describing biological systems.](https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btv484)
> *Bioinformatics* 32 (4): 563-570;

This module implements general difference detection stategies for computational models encoded in standard format.
**More documentation on the BiVeS-Core** can be found and the [GitHub pages of the SEMS project](https://semsproject.github.io/BiVeS-Core/).

## BiVeS consists of several modules

BiVeS itself consists of a number of modules:

* [xmlutils](https://github.com/binfalse/xmlutils) is a library for advanced XML handling
* [jCOMODI](https://github.com/binfalse/jCOMODI/) provides programmatic access to the [COMODI ontology](http://purl.uni-rostock.de/comodi/)
* [BiVeS-Core](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-Core) is the core library for comparison of computational models
* [BiVeS-SBML](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-SBML/) is a module providing special strategies for models encoded in SBML
* [BiVeS-CellML](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-CellML) is a module providing special strategies for models encoded in CellML
* [BiVeS](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS) ties all modules together and provides command line access
* [BiVeS-WebApp](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-WebApp) is a web interface to access BiVeS through the network
* [BiVeS-WebApp-Client](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-WebApp-Client) provides a Java library for comparing models using the BiVeS-WebApp


## Usage of BiVeS

To use BiVeS you should have a look at the [BiVeS framework](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS) or the [BiVeS-WebApp](https://github.com/binfalse/BiVeS-WebApp).
